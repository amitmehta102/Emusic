# 🎵 Emotion-Based Music Player

An **AI-powered Emotion-Based Music Player** that detects human emotions in real time using a webcam and recommends music accordingly.  
This project combines **Deep Learning**, **Computer Vision**, and **Web Application Development**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

The **Emotion-Based Music Player** analyzes facial expressions captured through a webcam and classifies emotions using a deep learning model.  
Based on the detected emotion, the system recommends or plays suitable music.

The project demonstrates practical use of:
- Facial landmark detection
- Emotion classification
- Real-time video processing
- AI-based recommendation logic

---

## 🧠 Emotions Detected

- Happy  
- Sad  
- Calm  
- Energetic  

Each emotion maps to a different music mood.
